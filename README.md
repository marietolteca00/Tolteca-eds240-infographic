# Agriculture Crop Recommendation

Final Project Infographic for EDS-240

##### Author: Marie Tolteca

##### Date: 01/21/2025

In this repository, I will find which agriculture crops are best to grow in different areas depending on chemicals found in the soil. The chemicals that I am interested in are Phosphorus, Potassium, Nitrogen, and atmospheric levels. The crop type will range from rice to lentils to coffee with other crops in between.

Questions:

What is the most consumed crop that farmers should be informed about to plant more? (will probably need to join another dataset)

Which crop type has higher levels of Nitrogen and ph levels?

# Data Access

Data was retreived from a website called Kaggle a platform for data scientist and machine learning individuals. The [Crop Recommendation Dataset]('%3Chttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishank2005/crop-reproduction-ecosystem-recommendation/data%3E'), this is an agricultural dataset containing soil and environmental parameters.
