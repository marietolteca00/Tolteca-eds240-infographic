1. Restate the questions you hope to answer with your inforgraphic. This should include one overarching question (think of this as driving the overall theme of your infographic) and at least three subquestions (each of which will be addressed by your infographic’s component visualizations). Have these questions changed at all since FPM #1? If yes, how so? 

- Overall Question: Am I mastering Marvel Rivals? How can I optimize my Marvel Rivals gameplay?
- Sub-questions:
  - Which role should I main? (role, win_rate, hero_name)
  - Should I focus on Competitive or Quick Match? (mode, win_rate, kd_ratio)
  - Am I improving across seasons or plateauing? (season, win_rate, duration)
  - Which maps favor my best heroes? (map_id, hero_name, win_rate)
  Yes from FPM 1, my questions and data have switched. I was able to get an API for my account on the video game I play called Marvel Rivals.
  
2. Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer the above questions, and how.
- The variables I intend to use are 
- "map_id", "map" = Same thing, map just has a total count of map_id
- "duration" = Time spend on each match
- "season" = Seasons 3-6            
- "mode"  = Competitive or Quick Play Match 
- "kills", "deaths"= Get averages, and combine with hero or hero type
- "hero_name", "role" = Hero names and types (duelist, stragestist, vanguard)
- "total_hero_damage", "total_damage_taken", "total_hero_healing" = Still debating too use              
- "win_rate" = Combine with heroes or maps to see which ones I have done better in

# Data Viz - Examples to use for my infographic
I think all of these are great and have an idea on how i would like to incorprate them onto some visuals that I will make. I am thinking to add maps and add in the heroes I am best on each map. As well as I can have kill/death average with a picture of the top five character in the middle similar to the pokemon one . 

# Part 6
1. What are the key insights you want your infographic to communicate, and how will your design choices help highlight and support those messages?
- I would like to demonstrate what the game, maybe a simple walk through. There is a team of 5 that can be used to have as many roles (duelist, strategist, vanguard), maybe show a picture or have a group of characters at the top and add labels to them. Then I would like to show my progress in two type of game modes, competitive where ranks can be achieved faster, the higher the rank the better one gets with a specific hero and Quick match is more of a chill gameplay, where it doesn't hurt your rank but rather lets you practice with others. 
- Following this I would like to showcase which hero I get more kills/ death on average to see if I should out-rank and become lord or try other characters.
- Lastly, I woul like to show my win rate with the three types of duelist, strategist, or vangaurd.

2. What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R? If you struggled with mocking up any of your three visualizations, describe those challenges here.
I realized that not all my matches made it to the csv. It seems like the data on the csv or retrieved from the API, only counts matches where I only played as one character not counting when I would switched heroes. As well as the ranks aren't list, it would've been a great way to demonstrate the ranks of each hero character I played throughout the seasons. I attempted at adding an image to the characters but that didn't work out. As well as I got the inspiration from the pokemon infographic and will try to do that with Kill/death average. Some of the visuals I already had and created new ones for the new subquestions I added. Just need to dial down some of the questions and refine my visuals.

3. What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven’t covered in class that you’ll be learning how to use for your visualizations?
I used ggimage and patchwork for now. Not necessarily any packages that we used in class.

4. What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message and key insights are clear?
If my overall question is good, to narrow down my subquestions. I feel like once I get the green light I will be able to refine and create more awesome visuals, right now they're pretty basic and standard.
